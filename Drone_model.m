% this code written for making the animation of Quadcoptor model, all units
% are in meters, in this code of example we are using 'HGtransform'
% function for animate the trajectory of quadcopter

 %% 1. define the motion coordinates 
 % roll , pitch and yaw input in degree 
    t    = 0:0.03:10;   % simulation time for 10 second
    z     = t/3;        % z in meter 
    frq   = 0.25;
    frq_rp = 4*frq;
    y     = sin(2*pi*frq*t);   
    x     = cos(2*pi*frq*t);
    yaw   = (2*pi*frq*t)*(180/pi); % yaw in degree (full rotation in simulation period)
    roll  = 3*sin(2*pi*frq_rp*t);  % 3 degree sinusoidal roll input for test
    pitch = 3*cos(2*pi*frq_rp*t);  % 3 degree sinusoidal pitch input for test

 %% 6. animate by using the function makehgtform
 % Function for ANimation of QuadCopter
  drone_Animation(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw)
